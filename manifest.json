  "description": "Turn javascript off on medium-platform sites while repairing the site so that images work.\n\nOn medium sites that aren't under the medium.com domain, click on the un-mediumify button in the URL bar to repair the image links.\n\nMedium is just a blog platform. A blog post is a web page with text and images, sometimes embedded videos. It doesn't and shouldn't need javascript.\n\nWhenever I visit sites that are using medium, my browser uses far too much CPU for what should be a static page.\n\nI also find abhorrent that Medium thought it a good idea to modify the current URL in the browser bar with a tracking number after the fragment identifier (hash mark).   This anti-feature breaks a must-have browser functionality: on non-broken websites, when I reload the page, the browser puts me at the same position in the page as I last left it (behavior that is broken by Medium javascript).\n\nTherefore, there is a need for a stop-the-fan-from-spinning and stop-the-idiocy browser extension that makes reading on Medium sites a bearable experience.\n\nThis WebExtension turns javascript off on medium-platform sites while still repairing image links so that it can be read as any other blog (because, for whatever nonsense reason, images aren't loaded and don't appear if you don't enable javascript on Medium. F**k you, Medium, seriously).\n",
